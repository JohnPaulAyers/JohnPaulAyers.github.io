        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p> I have been stay-at-home parent from 2013 to present. I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to re-enter to job market as my spouse, who works for the State of Oregon, is now
          able to work from home indefinitely. If you are reading this hopefully you are looking over my application. This is an old project I'm repurposing for my job search.
          The intention is to simply show some degree of technical competency through the creation of my very own website. Being a web developer isn't something I could do for a living, but I do have both the
          background and resourcefulness to scrap together this website.  Thank you for visiting and for you consideration.  </p>

          <h3>Computer/Technical</h3>
          <p>I can build, maintain, and troubleshoot PC hardware as well as install/deploy the appropiate software to accompany specified conditions.  I've been building PCs from scratch for nearly 20 years as a hobby
            and as a result have developed many general skills surrounding computer software and hardware.  I can set-up, configure, and maintain small networks as necessary.  I also have intermediate level of skill around
          html, css, and SQL.  </p>

          <h3>Soft Skills </h3>
          <p>My time working has primarily been doing delivery, almost nine years cumulatively.  In that time not only have I developed, but also increased the skills needed to succeed in an environment that heavily
            revolves around customer service and logistics. Communication was essential between both co-workers and customers; delegating concerns, alterations to orders, and disputes between the parties was one of my primary roles.
            Time management was a persistent consideration throughout the day. I was faced with strict deadlines and adaptability was needed for an ever-changing set of circumstances. Not only was I faced with extraordinary
            time-constraints, but often problems that needed to be resolved quickly in specific time frames as well.  This lead to a regular overlap of being required to find solutions to intersecting issues.
            I'm looking for an opportunity to contribute these skills to an organization that fosters stewardship and serves the public.
